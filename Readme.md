# MLT3 Attachment Export
This repository is a result of an urgent task, having a need to retreive attachments from MLT, converting these images to pdf if needed, and 
exort one or more result files either in its / their original MIME type, or as a final pdf.

This program is designed to work as a web application, and as such it is made effective to be adapted in future as a web service in MLT.

## Running the project
- Start up the application, e.g. start up Springboot
- in the Terminal, type: http://localhost:8080/attachments-get
- you may supervise the process from the Running interface.
